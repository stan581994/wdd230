                <h2>The Museo de La Salle</h2>
                <p>
                    The Museo de La Salle, located within the campus of the De La Salle University-Dasmariñas, is a
                    unique, cultural, cross-disciplinary institution serving as a permanent museum of the De La Salle
                    University System. As a resource center for both indoor and outdoor collections, it dedicates itself
                    to the gathering of collectible objects of intrinsic value significant to the preservation of
                    certain aspects of the Philippine ilustrado lifestyle.</p>

                <p>
                    The Museo de La Salle envisions itself to be a leading contributor to the Philippine University
                    museums' movement. It seeks to form productive partnerships that serve communities in creative ways.
                    It vows to assist the member schools of the System in the core areas of teaching, research,
                    community outreach, and administration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through active collaboration with other museums in the nation, it promotes the interests of
                    museology and upholds appreciation of the arts and culture.

                <h2>The St. Francis of Assisi Parish Church</h2>
                <p>The St. Francis of Assisi Parish Church, also known as the San Francisco de Malabon Parish Church and
                    commonly known as the General Trias Church, is the first Roman Catholic parish church of the
                    municipality of General Trias in Cavite province in the Philippines. Typical of towns established
                    during the Spanish colonial period, the church is located at the plaza (town square) of General
                    Trias, which was formerly called San Francisco de Malabon in honor of its patron saint, Saint
                    Francis of Assisi.</p>
                <p>Attached to the church is the convent. It is where the Banda San Francisco de Malabon, a local
                    marching band, practiced the music of the Philippine national anthem Marcha Filipina before
                    performing it during the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, in
                    Kawit, Cavite.[4] The convent now houses the Museo de San Francisco de Malabon.</p>

                <h2>La Madre Filipina</h2>
                <p>The first La Madre is holding a torch on one hand a bouquet of flowers on another. The statues
                    symbolize the Filipino’s aspirations for democratic self-rule which they can achieve through
                    education. This La Madre was destroyed during the Battle of Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    The second La Madre Filipina is a mother comforting a crying man on one side while embracing a child
                    on the other. This statue is a message for the younger generation to be grateful for the sacrifices
                    of those before them. The statue was formerly displayed in Rizal Park before it was moved back to
                    the bridge.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The third La Madre Filipina, located on the Binondo side, depicted a woman holding a torch and
                    looking at the child. The statues symbolize the necessity of education and sacrifice in improving
                    the lives of children. The statue is located at the Court of Appeals.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth La Madre Filipina is depicted sitting with two equally tall children genuflecting at her
                    sides. The symmetry of the statue represents equality under the law. This statue is also located at
                    the Court of Appeals.

                    <h2>Taal Volcano Island</h2>
                    <p>Small but terrible is how most Caviteños and Batanguenos describe Taal volcano. Although
                        relatively small in nature, Taal Volcano is the second most active volcano in the Philippines,
                        Taal Volcano is small yet active; low yet deadly. Nonetheless, its plendor view keeps on luring
                        travelers in and outside of the country. It is also popularly known as “a volcano within a lake,
                        and a lake within a volcano”. The most prominent of which is the Crater Lake, which dominates
                        the central portion of the Volcano Island. Taal Volcano Island is a 23 sq km post-caldera
                        feature and is composed of 47 identified cones and craters. On the island is the 2-km wide and
                        80-m deep Main Crater Lake. Volcanic processes such as base surges, ashfalls, and effusions of
                        lava led to the formation of this island volcano.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taal Volcano Protected Landscape (TVPL) has a total area of 62,292.1369 hectares covering the
                        Taal Volcano Island, Taal Lake, and the watershed areas of the surrounding municipalities. TVPL
                        was formerly known as Taal Volcano Island National Park by the virtue of Proclamation No.235
                        dated July 22, 1967. In 1996, President Fidel V. Ramos declared the island park as a protected
                        area under the category of protected landscape under Proclamation No. 923 consequently bearing
                        its new name. The declaration was made in order to preserve the scenery as well as the animals
                        and plants thriving in the area.</p>
